# Nuxanorify
A simple extension that adds Nux Taku to YouTube thumbnails and replaces all singular first-person pronouns in titles with plural equivalents.

Contributions are welcome. I made this extension in 2 hours on a train so it might not be perfect and some things might not work.

## Download
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I have uploaded the extension to Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons, but Google and Mozilla needs to review the extension before you can download it. For now, you need to manually install it.

## Manual install

4. Make a new folder and unzip it here
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder that you just made

### Firefox
> [!WARNING]  
> You need to do this every time you restart your browser. No idea why, probably for safety.
